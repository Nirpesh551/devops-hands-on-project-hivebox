> [!CAUTION]
> **[Fork](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/devops-hands-on-project-hivebox/fork)** this repo, and create PRs in your fork, **NOT** in this repo!

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for the full roadmap, including this project, go back to the [getting started](https://devopsroadmap.io/getting-started) page.

This repository is the starting point for [HiveBox](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/), the end-to-end hands-on project.

You can fork this repository and start implementing the [HiveBox](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/) project. HiveBox project follows the same Dynamic MVP-style mindset used in the [roadmap](https://devopsroadmap.io/).

The project aims to cover the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). That means each phase will cover all aspects of DevOps, such as planning, coding, containers, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure, etc.

Happy DevOpsing ♾️

## Before you start

Here is a pre-start checklist:

- ⭐ <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/dynamic-devops-roadmap">Star the **roadmap** repo</a> on GitHub for better visibility.
- ✉️ <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.devopsroadmap.io/subscribe">Join the community</a> for the project community activities, which include mentorship, job posting, online meetings, workshops, career tips and tricks, and more.
- 🌐 <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/DevOpsHive/985">Join the Telegram group</a> for interactive communication.

## Preparation

- [Create GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) (if you don't have one), then [fork this repository](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/devops-hands-on-project-hivebox/fork) and start from there.
- [Create GitHub project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) for this repository (use `Kanban` template).
- Each phase should be presented as a pull request against the `main` branch. Don’t push directly to the main branch!
- Document as you go. Always assume that someone else will read your project at any phase.
- You can get senseBox IDs by checking the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) website. Use 3 senseBox IDs close to each other (you can use the following [5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786), [5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488), and [5ade1acf223bd80019a1011c](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5ade1acf223bd80019a1011c)). Just copy the IDs, you will need them in the next steps.

## Implementation
## My Implementation of HiveBox Project (as of December 28, 2025)

This is my personal fork and implementation of the HiveBox hands-on project from the DevOps roadmap.

### What I have built so far

- **Backend**: FastAPI application with 3 endpoints:
  - `/version` → returns current API version
  - `/health` → simple health check
  - `/temperature` → calculates average temperature from 3 real public senseBoxes using openSenseMap API + adds status ("Too Cold", "Good", "Too Hot")
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics endpoint `/metrics`
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Dockerfile (Python 3.12 slim → small production image)
- **Kubernetes**: Deployed to **microk8s** on Ubuntu server
  - Deployment with 1 replica
  - NodePort Service (port 30080 on host)
  - Ingress with self-signed TLS → HTTPS access at https://hivebox.local
- **Packaging**: Helm chart (`hivebox-chart`) for easy install/upgrade
- **TLS**: Self-signed certificate for HTTPS (browser shows warning, but works)

### Current Architecture
Browser → HTTPS (Ingress + self-signed TLS) → NGINX Ingress Controller
↓
NodePort Service (30080)
↓
Deployment → Pod (FastAPI)
↓
Calls → openSenseMap API (real data)


### How to Run It (Step by Step)

#### Prerequisites (on Ubuntu server with microk8s)
- microk8s installed & running
- Ingress addon enabled: `microk8s enable ingress`
- Docker
- Helm 3+

#### 1. Clone your fork & build Docker image

git clone https://github.com/Nirpesh551/devops-hands-on-project-hivebox.git
cd devops-hands-on-project-hivebox

docker build -t hivebox:0.0.1 .
microk8s ctr image import <(docker save hivebox:0.0.1)

#### 2. Deploy with Helm (recommended)
helm upgrade --install hivebox ./hivebox-chart

#### 3. Access the application
Best way (HTTPS)
